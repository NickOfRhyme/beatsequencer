# beatsequencer

This is a simple beatsequencer I built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.

Please note that there are some stuttering issues in Firefox, especially on slower computers.  I recommend running it in Chrome or Opera.

There is hosted version of the sequencer [here](https://nickofrhyme.github.io/projects/beatsequencer).
